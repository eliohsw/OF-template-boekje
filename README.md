# OF-template-boekje

A lightweight, multipurpose book template built for XeLaTeX.

This template supports multilingual documents via Polyglossia, primarily handling Latin and CJK text.

To compile the document, type `make` or `make xelatexmk` in your terminal, or by clicking **Recompile** on Overleaf (make sure compiler `XeLaTeX` and main document `book.tex` are configured in the settings).
